         DISAPPEARANCE OF THE "MONA LISA" RECALLS THEFT OF FAMOUS GAINSBOROUGH Leondaro's Painting IS Regarded as the Finest In the World "Duchess od Devonshire" Was Returned After Quarter of a Century
         By JAMES A.EDGERTON THE dissapearance of the famous "Mona Lisa" of Leondardo da Vinci from the Louvre, at Paris, is the lastest nine days' wonder in the world of art. This great painting, also known as "La Giocondo", has been pronounced by many the finest in the world.
         It certainely stands in a list of the world's half dozen greatest paintings and in popular regard perhaps ranks second only to the "Sistine Madinna" by Raphael. Some think "The Last Supper," also by Da Vinci, greater than "Mona Lisa," but this sort of comparison is fruitless, as the two paintings 
         are quite different in the subject and treatment. The loss of this picture is regarded by the FRench as a national calamity. To them it is not only priceless, but a part of their very life. It has been reported, and is probably true, that the French government once refused an offer of $5,000,000 for the painting. 
         Upon its dissapearance the Louvre was closed for several dats, a large force of police was set to work searching every nook and cranny of the great building, and sixty detectives were started working on the outside. One of the theories of the authorities was that the theif was a young man who was known to have become enamored of the painting and who had visitedit at intervals 
         for several months, sitting before it with a rapt expression for hours together. They believe that he fell in love with the face, as painters have been known to become enamored of their own works, and grew insane upon the subject, his mania finally prompting the crime. So much people were affected by this masterpiece that some shed tears at sight of it. Not a few letters have been received at the Louvre addressed to "Mona Lisa" and expressing love to her as to a living person.
         That the deed was the owrk of some deranged person seems almost certain for the reason that the picture could not be disposed of and hence would be without value of the thief. A painting is only valuable when shown. If the criminal could dispose of i to a private collector and it cannot be conceived that any thief would dare to offer it for sale or that any collector would be so foolish or depraved as to buy such collector would not dare exhibit it for fear of detection. While there are many
         copies of the painting that the average man could hardly detect from the original, there are always those who can distinguish and now that the whoel world is on the lookout for the picrure every copy will be subjected to closer inspection. Moreover, an old master is chiefly valuable because it is an original, and to be able to refer to it as such and to know in his heart that the claim is true constitute its chief value to the collector; hence insanity of one form or another is the only rational explanation of the act. That paradox and all.
         An interesting fact in this connection is that several months ago it was reported in the public print that "Mona Lisa" had been stolen and a copy substituted in its place. This was afterward denied, but the dissappearance now makes it seem a strange coincidence, almost a prophecy. There is one other possible explanation. It is notorious that in Europe the trade of making fake "old masters" flourishes apace, chiefly for the purpose of guilling American millionaires. These copies are properly aged by processes that the fakers know and are then sold for
         fabulous prices to those who have more money than expert knowledge or perhaps real appreciation of "old masters." To do this work fakers have to posses originals in order that the copy may be as nearly perfect as possible. Sometimes these imitiations are so close that they fool even the experts. Many pictures have been stolen in the past, but none even approaching the values of "Mona Lisa." The most famous case in modern times was the theft of Gainsborough's famous portrait of the "Duchess of Devonshire." The "electioneering duchess" she was called, having been active in her husband's
         political canvasses. This painting was missing nearly a quarter of a century and was finally returned through the instrumentality of the late Pat Sheedy, the "square" gambler. Sheedy's version of the affair was that the theif was Adam Worth, whom Sheedy regarded as the greatest criminal of the last century. The painting wasoriginally stolen to be used in an effort to get one of Worth's accomplices out of jail. The man escaped on a technicality, however, and Worth had the picture on his hands. He did not dare to sell it or even to mention its existence. The painting was kept in a hermetically sealed case in the false bottom of a trunk. The Pinkertons,
         believed that Worth wasthe thief, but could not prove it. This is where Sheedy came into the case. Worth had at one time done Sheedy a kindness-$2000 worth of kindness, to be exact. Pinkerton heard of this and asked Sheedy that if he ever saw Worth again to find out about the Gainsborough. Some years later, when Sheedy was running a gambling joint in Constantinople, he received word from Adam Worth, who was in trouble, as usual. Sheedy, of course, more than made good the former loan and got Worth out. He then mentioned the matter of the Gainsvorough, and Worth replied that he was on the point of breaking the ice on that subject himself. The upshot of it all was that Sheedy acted as a go-between 
         got the picture out of the false bottom of the trunk where it was in storage in Boston, had the British owners over to examine it, collected the $25,000 reward, presumably turned over the money to Adam Worth and his pals and as a result of the incident got into "art" himself. Worth was so grateful for Sheedy's action in the Gainsborough affair that before his death he insisted on giving Pat an original Murillo which had been stolen out of some monastery. When this came into his hands Sheedy tried to find the rightful owners, advertising extensively in South America and elsewhere, but failed. Some years later he heard that Raisuli, the Moroccan bandit, had in his possession a Correggio, which was also
         obtained. Pat;s reputation as a connoisseur in high art was made.

         On August 21, 1911, the picture was missed from its place in the Louvre.The guard thought the official photographer had taken it to his studio to copy it, as he often did. It was not until late Tuesday evening that the guard announced the picture had been stolen. After a hasty search, heavy frame was found under a stairway leading to one of the cloakrooms. A scaffold against the facade of the Louvre, placed there in connection with the installation of an elevator, made it easy to enter or leave the building. A persom acquainted with the interior and provided with keys to the various rooms could easily reach the Salon Carre where the picture hung. Some say the portrait was stolen as an object lesson, to show how
         careless the keepers of the Louvre were and how easily pictures could be stolen. Others think perhaps an artist has stolen it and will return a reproduction and keep the original, or that a big reward will be demanded and its payment the picture will be returned in an indirect way after the excitement has dies down. More romantic than any of these conjectures is that "Mona Lisa" is another Helen of Troy. Some one has fallen in love with her and in desperation carried her off to his secret altar from the stare of the croeds and jealousy guard her from the eyes of other worshipers.
         Where "Mona Lisa" is hidden, she is carefully guarded, for no trace has been found; and Paris, as well as thousands of sightseers who have gazed upon her beauty, are still wondering and talking of her dissappearance.

         Trying to Steal Mona Lisa's Sister How the Authorities at the Louvre Hope to Save Leonardo da Vinci's Other Masterpiece from the Fate That Overtook "La Joconde." PAris, SINCE "Mona Lisa" was so mysteriously stolen from the Louvre, the authorities of that world-famous art museum have been warned, and have taken unusual precautions to save Leonardo da Vinci's sister masterpiece from a similar fate. This painting, equally esteemed by art connoisseurs, but overshadowed for the mass of visitors by the enormous fame of "Mona Lisa"
         -or "La Joconde," as the French call it, because of its haunting smile-is an idealized portrait od Lucrezia Crevelli, the beautiful young Lombard poetess who inspired Lombardo's brush during the earlier period of his fame. Owing to the jewelled band which encircles the brow, the picture is called "La Belle Ferronniere." In this case Leonardo performed marvels with a pair of wonderful eyes, which are hardly less compelling in their influence than the elusive smile of "Mona Lisa." paris devotees at the shrine of the great Lombardo have always divided
         their acts of devotion pretty equally between "Mona Lisa" and "La Belle Ferronniere," standing before them for hours in evident rapture over that smile and those eyes, and then going home and writing love letters to them. These love letters of prtraits of Italian beauties three hundred yeaers in their graves are always opened and read by the Louvre authorities. To the writer of some such letters they attribute the theft of "Mona Lisa." Since the dissappearance of that masterpiece the devotional visits and letters to "La Belle Ferronnieere" have doubled in numbers, and the actions
         of some of the visitors and letter writers have been so fanatical that the painting has been placed under a competent guard night a day. It is also guarded against a too close approach by nay but its official custodians. When Leonardo da Vincii painted Lucrezia he was still a "primitive." He had not yet discovered the effect of light and atmonsphere When he painted the poetess he was a pagan-when he produced "Mona Lisa" he was a mystic. Not less marvellous either in conception or execution is the portrait of Lucrezia than that of her better known sister. It is more subtle more difficult to understand,
         that is all. In all the world there does not exist more than a baker's dozen of absolutely authentic paintings by Leonardo. He produced but one great work of sculpture, a esquestrain statue that stood before the feudal castle of his princely, but illigigtimate ancestors, the Sforzesco family of Milan. During the wars that swept over Europe between Charles the Fifth, Henry the Eigth and Francis the First, from which northern Itlay suffered so much and when so many princely treasures were destroyed, this historic monument and the majority of da Vinci's paintings dissappeared. Since the recent dissapearance of the "Mona Lisa" a most
         rigid surveillance is kept over this other great portrait. Already the fickle public is fast losing interest over the lost "Mona Lisa" and the beautiful poetess who held the younger Leonardo under her magic sway is to replace the sphinx-like "La 
         Joconde." Instead if the unfathomable smile, one ponders over the tempting bow-mouth, the finely chiselled lips with a sensitive turn at the corners; instead of those glistening with humor, sometimes cruel and snake-like, ever enigmatical, ine revels in the depths of those glorious eyes that Leonardo has preserved for us those great intresting eyes of the Lombard poetess whose inner mind is so revealed in the face yet who seems to ask the question that "Mona Lisa" knew and defied the world to answer. It was the Salle Carre(Square Hall) of the Louvre that contained "Mona Lisa," as ther the light is most favorable. That the equally beautiful "La Belle Ferronniere" has been kept in the semi-seclusion of the long, narrow gallery, however has not hidden it from Leonardo enthusiasts, and now the general public has discovered the
         sister painting, thronging the less favired gallery and adding to the perplexities of the custodians.

        STOLE 'MONA LISA' TO AVENGE ITALY Italian Workingman Resented Art Spoliation by the First Napoleon. ITS RETURN TO FRANCE TO BE WITH CEREMONY Art Dealer Through Whom Painting Was Recovered May Get Reward of $48,000. FLORENCE Italy, December 13.-the authenticity ofthe "Mona Lisa" found yesterday in possession of Vincenzo Perguia was confirmed by experts after further examination today. The picture bears the seals of the Louvre and other galleries in which it has been hung, while the traces of repairs ar the back of the canvas also are visible. The prisoner was again interrogated by the police authorities this morning. He
        repeated his story of having stolen the picture as an act of patriotic vengeance for Napoleon's depredations in Italy. He displayed the utmost indignation at his treatment by the police, declaring it unjust after the risks he had run and the abnegation he had demonstrated out of patriotic sentiment. A number of prominent Italians have written to the Italian piblic instruction requesting him to permit "Mona Lisa" to be placed on exhibition in Florence, its former home, before returning it to the French government. Some weeks ago an Italian wrote to Signor Geri, an antiquary of Florence, saying :"I am in possession of the missing "Mona Lisa, " but being a patriotic Italian I desire that it shall reamian in Florence, the center of Italian art." he igned the letter "Leonard," and the antiquary at first paid small attention to it, thinking he had to do with a madman . Later, however, he communicated with Dr. Poggi, director of the Florentine museums, who suggested that he continue the correspondence with the man. This was done, and an appointment was arranged whereby Geri was to view the picture at Milan.
        The date set was November 17, but unforseen circumstances prevented the meeting. Recognizes "Mona Lisa." A young man fairly well dressed, visited Geri thursday. He said he was "Leonard" and was staying  at the Hotel Tripoli. He asked Geri to go with him to see the picture. The dealewr notified Dr. Poggi, who hastened to the hotel, and on being recognized it as the genuine "Mona Lisa." Dr. Poggi asked to be allowed to take the picture with him, so that he might compare it with other works. He made an appointment to meet "Leonard" yesterday afternoon at the hotel, to agree upon the price, The director took with him several officers, who placed the man under arrest. On being interrogated the prisoner said his real name is Vincenzo Perugia, thathe was born in the province of como, is by profession a decorator, and is unmarried. For six years he lived in France, and for three years was employed at the Louvre. Perugia posed as a patriot. "I was ashamed he said, "that for more than a century no Italian had thought of avenging the spoliation committed by Frenchmen under Napoleon, when they carried off from the Italian mueseums and
        galleries pictures, status and treasures of all kinds by wagonloads, ancient manuscripts by thousands, and gold by sacks." Stolen Early in Morning He had often observed, he said, in the Louvre many works of art stolen from Italy, and conceived the idea of returning to its true home Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. He entered the Louvre early in the morning, detached the pciture beneath his workman's blouse, and succeeded in leaving the place without attracting suspicion. At the time of the theft Perugia was not employed in the Louvre, but he knew all the exits and entrances, and how to avoid attention. He kept the painting concealed. he said, until his patriotism led him to offer it to the Italian people. the picture was identified by Dr. Corrado Ricci, director general of the department of fine arts, who was dispatched hurriedly to Florence from Rome by the minister of public instruction, Luigi Credaro. Finger Prints Confirm Confession. PARIS, December 13.-Rene Viviani, French minister of the public instruction, announced at the cabinet council today that there was no doubt the picture "Mona Lisa" had been recovered and was now at Florence, Italy.
        He said he had telegraphed to the Italian premier thanking him and the Italian government for their prompt action. A representative of the fine arts department is on the way to Rome to bring the picture back to Paris. Fresh proof that "Mona Lisa" was taken from the Louvre by Vincenzo Perugia was established today when his finger prints taken when he was convincted some time ago of carrying firearms without a permit were compared with those on the frame and glass of the picture and found exactly similar. The finger prints on the glass and frame were preserved by the police and the similarity with those of Perugia is apparent. Excitement in Paris. With "Mona Lisa" found what was one of the unfathomable mysteries has been solved. The sensatuon caused by its recovery was equaled only by that caused by its dissappearance in August, 1911. Special editions of the newspapers carried the news the length and breadth of Paris, and last night it was the sole topic of conversation. The Florence dealer, Geri, it iis believed, will be entitled to claim reqards amounting to 240,000 francs ($48,000) offered by the Society of Friends of the Louvre and Paris newspapers. 
        Regarded as Priceless. "Mona Lisa," or "La Joconde," is one of the world's famous paintings, and regarded as priceless. Leonardo da Vinci took as his model for the pictureLisa del S=GIocondo, a woman of Florence. He worked on the picture for four years, from 1500 to 1504. It was bought for France by Francis I. The value of the work can only be imagined since all offers to buy it were refused, among them ine reported to have been made by the British government of $5,000,000. The famous painting had hung in the place of honor in the Louvre in a room which was supposed to be always watched. It dissappeared on the morning of August 22, 1911, and its absence was not noticed by its guardians until some hours later.

        "MONA LISA" RECOVERED; THEIF IS IN CUSTODY it to its familiar place and guard it o that theft will be impossible." the Florentine dealer, Gri, it is believed, will be entitled to claim rewards amounting to 240,000 francs($48,000) offered by the Society of Fruends of the Louvre, and a paris newspaper." Expelled Director Joyous. M.J.Thomolele, who was director of the Louvre when "Mona Lisa" was stolen, and who was suspended by the French cabinet because of the loss of the painting, was overcome with jou when he learned of its recovery. Seymour de ricci, an eminent art critic of Paris, declared his faith in the certification of Dr. Corrado Ricci at Florenece of authenticity of the "Mona Lisa". "I do not think there is the slightest doubt," he said, "that the painting will be restored immediately to France." Italy has no claim whatever on the "Mona Lisa," which was given or sold to the French king, Francis I, by Leonardo da Vinci himslef. M. Viviani, minister of public instruction and M. Jacqueir, under-secretary for beaux arts, were both highlt elated over the auspicious event which ushers in their term of office. The Itlaian government has advised them that it will deliver over the picture at once and they are considering the best and safest means of conveying it back to the Louvre.
        The french government will take the earliest opportunity to express its gratitude to the italian givernment for the great service it has rendered in restoring the lost treasure. Perguia resided near the St. Louis hospital. He left here hurridely on Wednesday, saying he was obliged to go to Italy on important business. He is 22 years of age. The son of a carpenter. He came to Paris every year during the season and earned about eight francsa day, returning to some village when work was slack. Outside of a few compatriots, humble workers like himself, he was not known to have any friends in Paris. A neighbot of Perguia described him as an ordianry workman, having no special technical knowledge and completely ignorant in artistic matters. The neighbor, therefore, was astonished to hear that Perugia was accused of stealing the painting and believed that id the accusation were true he could only have been acting at the istigation of someone who had exploited his patriotic sentiments. It was possible, said the man, that Perugia had worked at the Louvre, but neither his relativesnor friends ever have heard it. ITALY WILL RETURN PICTURE TO FRANCE FLORENCE, ITALY DEc. 12 - "Mona Lisa," Leonardo da Vinci's great painting, which was stolen from the Louvre in paris more than two years ago has been found. It is now in the hands of the Italian authorities and will be returned to France.
        "Mona Lisa," or "La Giaconda," as it is more popularly known, the most celebrated portrait of a woman  ever painted, has been the subject of exhaustive search in all quarters of the globe. The mystery of its abstraction from the Louvre, its great intrinsic value, and the strange fascination of the smile of the woman it portrayed-Lisadel GIacondo, wife of a rich Florentine-have combined to keep alive interest in its recovery. The picture was recovered under curious circumstances. An Italian wrote to Signor Geri, an antiquary of Florence, some weeks ago saying: "I am in possession of the missing 'Mona Lisa,' but being a patriotic Italian, I desire that it shall remian in Florence, the center of Italian art." He signed the letter "Leonard," and the antiquary at first paid small attention to it, thinking he had to do with a madman. Later, however he communicated with Dr. Poggi, director of the Florentine mueseums, who suggested that he continue the correspondence with the man.

He asked Geri to go with him to see the picture. the dealer notified Dr. Poggi, who hastened to the hotel and on being shown the painting recognized it as the genuine "Mona Lisa." Dr Poggi asked to be allowed to take the picture with him so that he might comapre it with other works. He made an appointment to meet "Leonard" this afternoon to agree upon the price. The director took with him several officers, who placed the man underarresr.
        Passes as Patriot On being interrogated the prisoner said his real name was Vincenzo Perguia; that he was born in the province od Come, was by profession a decorator and unmarried. For six years was employed at the Louvre. Perguia, posed as a patriot."I was ashamed," he said, "that for more than a century no Italian had thought of avenging the spoilation committed by Frenchmen under Napoleon. When they carried off from the Italian mueseums and galleries pictures, statues and treasures of all kinds by wagon loads, ancient manuscripts by thousands and gold by sacks." He had often observed, he said, in the Louvre many works of art stolen from Italy, and conceived the idea od returning to its hime Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. He entered the Louvre early in the morning detached the picture and removed the painting from the frame. He concealed the frame under the back stairs, where it was afterward found. He hid the picture beneath his workaman's bliuse and succeeded in leaving the place without attracting suspicion. At the time of the theft Perguia was not employed in the Louvre but he knew all the exits and entrances and how to avoid attention. He Kept the painting concealed, he said, until his patriotism led him to offer it to the Italian people. Ricci Takes Big Risk. The painting has also been identified by Dr. Corrado Ricci, director general of the department of fine arts. Who was dispatched hurriedly to Florence from Rome by the minister of public instructiom, Luigi Credaro. After a careful examination, Dr. Ricci telephoned to the minister, who was incredulous. Ricci said: "I will stake my head." To this Senor Credaro replied: this news, after it is published, is found not to be true,
        you will be dismissed." Dr. Ricci answered: "I will take full responsibility and am willing to risk dismissal." News of the discovery of the "Mona Lisa" spread in the chamber of deptuies, in session at Rome, where extremist members were enagaged in flsticuffs in an endeavor to prevent a vote on the election of a Nationalist deputy for Rome. The disorder ceased immediately. The depties surrounded the minister of public instruction who exhibited a telegram from Dr. Rucci, confirming the statement he had already made by telephone. All laughed at the defense of the theif. Some of them remarked that Napoleon's deeds were too antiquated to constitute grounds for feuds. If it were not so Italy would quarrel with the whole world, as all countries, including the United States, had stolen masterpieces from her. The famous "Ascoll Cope," stolen from the cathedral at Ascoll, which was returned by J.Pierpont Morgan, was cited, however, as an instance of american generosity. Will Be Returned to France. Signor Credaro announced that Italy would apply the same generosity. He said he had immediately notified the French embassador, Camille Barrere of the discovery of the painting. He added: "Mona Lisa" will be delivered to the embassador with a solemnity worthy of Leonardo da Vinci and a spirit of happiness worthy of 'Mona Lisa's' smile. Although the masterpiece is dear to all Italians as one of the best productions of the genuis of their race, we will willingly return it to its foster country, which has regretted its loss so bitterly,as a fresh pledge of friendship and brotherhood between the two great Latin nations." The painting is in an almost perfect state of preservation, not withstanding the vicissitudes it must have undergone. Perguia, although he has not made a complete confession, 
        has admitted that he concealed it under the false bottom of a trunk, or fixed behind the canvas of a worthless sketch. MONA LISA MAKES A ROMAN HOLIDAY ROME, Dec. 12-All Rome rejoices at the finding of "Mona Lisa" King Victor Emmanuel was among the first to be informed. The news spread through the court and caused great gratification. The papal secretary of state, Cardinal Merry Del Val, conveyed the information to Pope Plus, when he was making his evening report. The pointiff said: "I am very happy that such a priceless treasure, after all, Is not lost to the world, and to the French nation." The French embassador expressed his thanks to the Italian premier, Signor Giolltti; the foreign minister, Marquis di San Giuliano and the minister of public instruction, Senor Credaro, for the notifications he had received regarding details of the discovery of the picture. He said that the French government and the French people would feel the deeepest gratitude for the generosity of the Italian government in desiring to return the masterpiece to the Louvre.

         HOW PAINTING WAS FOUND "Mona List," Missing Two Years, is Recovered. THEIF OFFERS TO SELL IT Conceived Idea of Returning Masterpiece to Its Trur Home to Avenge Looting of Nation b Napoleon. FLORENCE, Italy, Dec 13 - "Mona Lisa," Leonardo Da Vinci's great painting, which was stolen from the Louvre in Paris more than two years ago, has been found. It is now in the hands of the Italian authorities and will be returned to France. "Mona Lisa" or "La Jacomde." as it is more popularly known, the most celebrated portrait of a woman ever painted,
         has been the object of exhaustive search in all quarters of the globe. The mystery of its abstraction from the Louvre, its great intrinsic value and the strange fascination of the smile of the woman it portrayed, Lisa Del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine, have combined to keep alive interest in its recovery. The picture was recovered under curious circumstances. As Italian wrote to Signor Geri, an antiquary of Florence, several weeks ago, saying: "I am in possession of the missing Mona Lisa, but being a patriotic Italian, I desire that it shall remain in Florence, the center of Italian art." He signed the letter, "Leonard," and the antiquary at first paid small attention to it, thinking he had to do witha madman.

         province of Como, is by profession a decorator, and is unmarried. For six years he lived in France and for the three years was employed at the Louvre. Perugia posed as a patriot. 'I was ashamed,' he said, 'that for more than a century no Italian had thought of avenging the spoliation committed by Frenchmen under Napoleon, when they carried off from the Italian museums and galleries, statues and treasures of all kinds by wagon loads, ancient manuscripts by thousands, and gold by sacks.' He had often observed, he said, in the Louvre many works of art stolen from Italy and conceived the idea of returning it to its true home, Leonardo Da Vinci's masterpiece. He entered the Louvre early in the morning, detached the picture, and removed the painting from the frame. Hides it Under Blouse. He concealed the frame under the back stairs, where it was afterwards found.
         He hid the picture under the workman's blouse and succeeded in leaving the place without attracting suspicion. At the time of the theft, Perugia was not employed in the Louvre, but he knew all the exits and entrances and how to avoid attention. He kept the painting concealed, he said, until his patriotism led him to offer it to the Italian people. The painting has also been identified by Dr. Corrado Ricci, director general of the department of fine arts, who was dispatched hurriedly to Florence from Rome by the minister of public instruction, Luigi Credaro. After a careful examination, Dr. Ricci telephoned to the minister, who was incredulous. Ricci said: 'I will stake my head.' To this, Signor Credaro replied: 'I do not care for your head; but if this news after it is published, if found not to be true, you will be dismissed." Dr. Ricci answered: "I will take full 
         responsibility and am ready to risk dismissal." News of the discovery of the "Mona Lisa" spread in the Chamber of Deputies, in session at Rome, where extremist members were engaged in fisticuffs in an endeavor to prevent a vote on the election of a nationalist deputy. Disorder Ceases at Once. The disorder ceased immediately. The deputies surrounded the minister of public instruction, who exhibited a telegram from Dr. Ricci confirming the statement he had already made by telephone. All laughed at the alleged motives of the thief. One of them remarked that Napoleon's deeds were too antiquated to constitute grounds for feuds. If it were not so, Italy would quarrel with the whole world, as all countries, including the United States, had stolen masterpieces from it. The famous "Ascoli Cope," stolen from the cathedral at Ascoli, which was returned by J. Pierpont Morgan, was
         cited, however, as an instance of American generosity. Signor Credaro announced that Italy would show the same generosity. He said he had immediately notified the French ambassador, Camille Barrère, of the discovery of the painting. He added:'Mona Lisa' will be delivered to the ambassador with a solemnity worthy of Leonardo Da Vinci and a spirit of happiness worthy of 'Mona Lisa's' smile. Although the masterpiece is dear to all Italians as one of the best productions of the genius of their race, we will willingly return it to its foster country, which has regretted its loss so bitterly, as a fresh pledge of friendship and brotherhood between the two great Latin nations."  The painting is in an almost perfect state of preservation, notwithstanding the vicissitudes it must have undergone. Perugia, although he has not made a complete confession, has admitted that he 
         concealed it under the false bottom of a trunk or fixed it behind the canvas of a worthless sketch. Sensation in Paris. PARIS, Dec. 12—The sensation caused by the recovery of 'Mona Lisa' was only equaled by that caused by its disappearance in August, 1911. Special editions of the newspapers carried the news the length and breadth of Paris, and tonight it was the sole topic of conversation. The finding of 'Mona Lisa' had been so often announced, only to be contradicted, that the news was at first received with skepticism. However, Ambassador Barrère's dispatch from Rome to the French minister of public instruction, though brief, was explicit, and the names of the eminent Italian experts mentioned seemed a sufficient guarantee that it was the original painting. Henry Marcel, director general of the French National Museum, for a moment was inclined to doubt the news, saying:
        'We have so often been cruelly hoaxed that it is only natural that we should feel skeptical that the painting has been found. The telegram which I have read seems so clear and shows such detailed knowledge, however, that it seems to me the news must be true this time. In any case, the theft undoubtedly was the act of a madman. The motive—to avenge thefts committed in Italy by Napoleon—clearly shows this. 'If the experts' examination proves the picture to be authentic, we will restore it to its familiar place and guard it so that theft will be impossible.' The Florentine dealer, Geri, it is believed, will be entitled to claim rewards amounting to 240,000 francs ($48,000) offered by the Society of Friends of the Louvre and Paris newspapers. M. J. T. Homolle, who was director of the Louvre when 'Mona Lisa' was stolen and who was suspended by the French cabinet because of the 
        loss of the painting, was overcome with joy when he learned of its recovery. Seymour de Ricci, an eminent art critic of Paris, declared his faith in the certification of Dr. Corrado Ricci at Florence of the authenticity of the 'Mona Lisa.' 'I do not think there is the slightest doubt,' he said, 'that the painting will be immediately restored to France. 'Italy has no claim whatever on the "Mona Lisa," which was given or sold to the French king, Francis I, by Leonardo da Vinci himself. M. Viviani, minister of public instruction, and M. Jacquier, undersecretary for beaux arts, were both highly elated over the auspicious event, which ushers in their terms of office. The Italian government has advised them that it will deliver over the picture, and they considered the best and safest way of conveying it back to the Louvre. The French government will take the earliest opportunity 
        to express its gratitude to the Italian government for the service it has rendered in recovering the lost treasure. Perugia resided near the St. Louis hospital. He left here hurriedly on Wednesday, saying he was obliged to go to Italy on important business. He is 32 years old, the son of a carpenter. He came to Paris every year during the season and earned about eight francs a day, returning to some village when work was slack. Outside of a few compatriots, humble workers like himself, he was not known to have friends in Paris. A neighbor of Perugia described him as an ordinary workman, having no special technical knowledge and completely ignorant in artistic matters. The neighbor, therefore, was astonished to hear that Perugia was accused of stealing the painting and believed that if the accusation were true, he could only have been acting at the instigation of someone who
         had exploited his patriotic sentiments.

        Safeguarding the Treasures of the Louvre: Police Dogs, Locking Rods, Electric Signals, and Spy Chambers to Stop the Next Man from Quietly Walking Off with an 'Old Master' as Perugia Took 'Mona Lisa. Paris, February 8. The French Government is determined that 'Mona Lisa' shall not be stolen again. Extraordinary precautions have now been taken to prevent this or any other of the treasures of the Louvre from being taken away. One of the first steps taken to safeguard the Louvre was to employ a number of dogs of the clever breed known as police dogs. One of them guards every fifty feet of wall space day and night. No man can now put a hand over the railing in front of the pictures without having a dog after him. The next protective measure was to connect the pictures by a rod so that all those along a certain wall space can be locked up from one lock. Formerly, every picture hung
        separately. Under the new arrangement, each line of pictures hangs upon one flat rod by hooks in the frame, which only admit the rod when it is turned edgewise to the opening in the hook. Then the rod is turned so that the picture cannot be removed from it and is locked in that position. Little chambers have also been constructed behind the carved moldings near the ceiling, from which the guardians of the Louvre can secretly watch every person in the rooms. The knowledge that a hidden guardian is watching them is expected to have a terrifying effect on would-be thieves. The pictures have also been connected by electric wiring. Any tampering with them closes a circuit and causes an electric bell to ring loudly. The return of 'Mona Lisa' has only emphasized the necessity of guarding against similar occurrences in the future. The confession of Vincenzo Perugia has revealed the astonishing
        ease with which he was able to walk away with what is probably the most valuable art treasure in the world. It was on the morning of August 22, 1911, that the world was startled by the announcement that Leonardo da Vinci's great masterpiece had been stolen. Its disappearance from its accustomed place in the Salon Carré, or Square Salon, was noted on August 21. To some reporters who inquired intelligently about its disappearance, the officials on that day explained that it had been taken down to be cleaned. On the following day, the government decided that it was useless to attempt to conceal any longer the fact that it had been stolen. Its value was estimated at $5,000,000. It is interesting to recall some of the extraordinary speculations and theories that were advanced concerning its disappearance. Some argued that it was incredible that a government possession of such incalculable value 
        could be taken by a common thief. They said that some person of great influence, a Cabinet Minister or other high official, had taken the picture to photograph it, had damaged it accidentally, and was keeping it until he could repair it. Another theory was that the mysterious psychological and sex influence of the picture would prove to be the clue to its disappearance. It is well known that this exquisite and subtly fascinating portrait of Mona Lisa del Giocondo exerts a very diverse influence upon the two sexes. Men of impressionable temperament are strongly drawn toward it and feel a deep and even passionate pleasure in the radiations of its 'enigmatical smile.' Women, on the other hand, are, with equal frequency, repelled by it, and are even stirred to hate and fury by the same smile. The partisans of this theory fell into two groups. One group said that a man mentally disordered by 
        the strange fascination of the picture must have stolen it to enjoy its subtle charms in secret. The other group argued that a woman had taken it to vent the rage of her sex upon it. One thing became clear from the mass of theories and interesting facts brought out by the episode. The contents of the Louvre were not, and never had been, well safeguarded. Pictures worth from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 could have been pulled off their hooks at a favorable moment any day without detection. Officials, moreover, had been in the habit of lending the art treasures to artists and persons of influence. It was stated that 250 pictures had been stolen or 'borrowed' in the course of the nineteenth century. Gradually the months wore on and The recovery of the great picture came to be regarded as hopeless. Then, on December 12, 1913, came the news that it had been found. An art dealer informed the director
        of the Uffizi Gallery at Florence that an Italian workman named Vincenzo Perugia had taken the picture and had it in Florence. This statement was verified and the 'Mona Lisa' returned to France. The confession of Perugia shows that the subtle psychological influence of this picture had, indeed, much to do with his act. Perugia said: 'I am a patriotic Italian. I saw that the Louvre was filled with masterpieces stolen by Napoleon from Italy. I longed to take something back. 'I thought of taking a Raphael, a Titian, a Correggio, and several other masterpieces. But the Mona Lisa seemed to me much more appealing. 'Here she is. I give her back to my country. It is the greatest sacrifice of my life.' From Perugia’s confession, it appeared that he had worked as a painter for a decorating contractor of 280 Rue St. Honoré, Paris. He had worked as a painter on the Louvre for some weeks but gave up this
        work on January 24, 1911. Between this date and August 21, he meditated upon and carried out his plan for stealing the Mona Lisa. It was 7 o'clock in the morning of August 21 when he entered the Louvre. The building was open then for the workmen and guardians or caretakers, but the general public was not admitted that day. Perugia wore the long blouse commonly used by French workingmen, especially by house painters. He looked, of course, like a man working on the building. He walked straight up to the picture in the deserted Salon Carré and took it from the hooks by which it was hung. A man standing on the floor could reach his hand to the top of the small picture. Then he realized that the frame would be heavy and hard to conceal. He quickly removed the picture from the frame. He left the picture lying in the salon and carried the frame to a doorway a few yards away at the head of a small 
        stairway and left it outside the door. Then he returned for the picture. He thrust it under his loose blouse, where it was scarcely noticeable. Hearing footsteps, he decided to leave hurriedly by the small stairway where he had left the frame. As he went out, he put the key in his pocket to prevent anyone from pursuing him that way. Having reached the ground, he crossed the Courtyard of the Sphinx, and then passed out through the gateway known as the Porte Visconti, which faces on the Seine. The French authorities summoned Perugia, together with all the workmen who had worked on the Louvre at the time of or just before the theft. He proved that he had not worked there since January 24, and this seemed sufficient explanation. No one discovered that he was the thief until he revealed it himself.

        THE RESTORED MONA LISA By Frederic J. Haskin. "More deadly than the male," a woman outraged England and made all art lovers weep by hacking the incomparable Rokeby Venus. She did it to get the vote. It recalls the most famous of all art thefts—the stealing of the Mona Lisa by an Italian to avenge the depredations of Napoleon a century old. The complete story of that famous mystery only now may be told with authority. Smiling the same inscrutable smile which the master genius, Leonardo da Vinci, imprisoned upon canvas 400 years ago to the vexation of generations of interpreters, Mona Lisa, mysterious portrait, restored to her admirers after strangely vanishing under the eyes of her guards and eluding the frantic search of a nation of art lovers, again looks down from her place in the Louvre, Paris, the interest of her subtle, mystic expression enhanced by reason of her peculiar adventure.
        Mona Lisa, or, as the Italians call her, La Gioconda, on account of the haunting challenge which the artist divined in the face of his sitter and which he wove into the fabric of his colors, has enthralled and fascinated beholders from the beginning. Many explanatory pages have been written on the meaning of this famous painting, and, provoked by its indefinable charm, its elusive suggestion, many an art student has brought the full power of his critical acumen to the task of finding suitable words for the description of the picture’s strange appeal. Each attempt has failed, and each writer has dwelt with peculiar emphasis upon the qualities of the Mona Lisa smile. This masterpiece is one of the most treasured of the Louvre collection. It has been tentatively valued at more than a million dollars. Painting One of the Most Treasured. It was begun by da Vinci about 1503, when the master 
        stood at the zenith of his fame and power, and, according to Vasari, it took four years of intermittent labor to complete. The woman in whose likeness there was, or into which the artist wrought an intangible something, compelling, unrestful, questioning, in the mind of each who stared back at it, lived in Florence. She was Mona Lisa di Antonio Maria di Noldo Gherardini, a native of Naples, who was married in 1495 to Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a prominent citizen of Florence. When she began her sittings for what has since become one of the most renowned of all the world’s portraits, she was probably twenty-five or younger. Da Vinci, painter, poet, engineer, philosopher, and mystic, was fifty-one. Was it an unusual woman that the ripened master painted or was it a forceful symbol coined by his rich, discerning mind? Many times this question has been put to the lady 
        of the superior smile, answered only by the tantalizing glance through the thick, protecting varnish. No wonder, when the loss of their treasure was discovered on the morning of August 21, 1911, a Monday, all Paris was wrought to a frenzy. The news of the theft was received in all parts of the civilized world with the same feelings of dismay. The picture missing from its place in the Salon Carré was the most beautiful from Leonardo’s brush and one of the most precious creations of Western culture. Two Years Pass Without a Clue. Two years and four months passed by without a trace of the vanished work. All efforts of the French police remained fruitless. High rewards offered for the return of the painting went unclaimed, and every clue as to the Whereabouts of the thief ended just without the Louvre gates. As the months sped by while the endeavors of the police proved vain and not even 
        rumors came of a Mona Lisa in foreign lands, all hope that the picture would ever be recovered was given up. It was concluded that the work had been destroyed. The fate of Mona Lisa was put to the account of one of those unintelligible acts of vandalism which go to swell the records of human pathology. Boundless was the enthusiasm, then, which greeted the sudden, unexpected reappearance of the Gioconda Thursday, December 11, 1913, at Florence. In Florence, the original Mona Lisa had sat for a portrait by one of the greatest painters of all time, and in a dingy inn at Florence, the lost painting was found again. The Italian authorities obtained immediate possession of the picture, which was taken in triumphal procession through Italy, under police guard to Rome, to the French ambassador Barrère, and then to Milan, where the director-general of the Louvre, Henry Marcel, and the director 
        of paintings, M. Léprieur, came to take charge of it. The Mona Lisa was again safely housed in Paris last New Year’s Day, and was again hung in its accustomed place at the Louvre, which place had been filled during the time of its loss by Raphael's Castiglione. The theft of this irreplaceable work was an extraordinary one, in that the criminal had been able to penetrate one of the best-guarded treasure houses of Europe and make away with one of its most prized and precious possessions, and disappear with his loot without leaving a single trace behind. The thief was an unusual one, in that for two years and four months he kept his secret, the priceless Mona Lisa hidden away in his garret bedroom in Paris, only in the end to fall into the hands of the criminal authorities through an act of childish carelessness, an almost imbecile simplicity. Immediately, after the discovery of the theft,
        it was thought in Paris that the thief had hidden himself away in the gallery Saturday afternoon, remained in the place all night, and escaped with his spoil Monday morning. The glass casing and the frame of the picture were found leaning against the wall of a narrow stairway leading from the gallery des sept metres, where the old Italian pictures are hung, to the Court of the Sphinx. The door opening from the stairway, part of glass protected by ironwork, was locked, and, at the investigation, Sauvet, one of the workingmen in the Louvre, remembered having opened the door at the request of a person upon whom he came sitting at the bottom of the stairway. He failed to take further notice of this person, other than that he was wearing a blouse similar to those worn by the regular guards. As Monday is cleaning day, and visitors are barred, no suspicion crossed his mind but that the man was
        what he seemed—an official. Here the trail ended. A print of a left thumb upon the abandoned glass frame was all that remained in the way of a clue to the police. Notwithstanding full reports of the matter in L'Illustration, and other papers, nothing more of the criminal was learned. L'Illustration immediately announced that it would pay 40,000 francs, about $8,000, to anyone who would return the picture by September 26, and 45,000 francs—or $9,000—if the picture was brought to them by September 1. It was further announced that no questions would be asked. The editors received some five hundred letters in answer to their announcements, investigated some one hundred cases, and learned nothing. The Museum Club (Amis du Louvre) gave the police 25,000 francs to be used for the obtaining of the painting. The court of investigation convened August 22, and in its hearings the photographed thumb
        print played a leading role. No less than 257 persons were ordered by the court to submit their thumb prints for comparison. Among those furnishing such prints were the directors of the Louvre. The theif of course was not upin the list of those investigated. Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian, the real despoiler, as established by his own confession and the exact agreement of the fingerprint found upon the glass case with that of his own thumb, when taken into custody by the Italian police, cleared up the murky mystery. He maintained that he entered the Louvre, together with other workmen, Monday morning, made his way unobserved to the Mona Lisa, removed it from its hanging, carried it to the stairway where the frames were found, cut the painting loose from its casing, concealed it in his blouse, and persuaded a passing workman to open the door for him without so much as seeing a guard around. 
        Once outside the Louvre, he proceeded to his lodging house, a nest for a colony of Italian workmen, where he hid the picture and went on with his regular work—that of a house painter and glazier. He continued to ply his trade for more than two years, a thing worth to him a tremendous fortune concealed in the false bottom of his wooden trunk, before trying to dispose of it. Only once was the suspicion of the police directed upon him. But how he escaped that once is another mystery. Peruggia had been employed at the Louvre as a glazier and had been entrusted with the work of framing some of the most costly masterpieces. In October 1911, Prof. Pierre Marcel of the École des Beaux-Arts wrote an open letter to the paper Figaro, suggesting that trace of the criminal was to be sought among the Louvre glaziers. The director of painting took the suggestion, obtained the names of those so employed 
        and formerly so employed, upon which list appeared the name of Peruggia, who, with the rest, was subject to an examination and a house search. The mystery is that the police did not take the fingerprints of these men for comparison, as had been done at the first investigation. Peruggia's downfall came with his attempt to dispose of his spoil. He wrote on November 28, 1913, to Alfred Geri, owner of the Galleria d'Arte e Moderna, at Florence, a dealer in art works, offering, under the name of Leonardi, to sell him the Mona Lisa, which he explained, as a patriotic Italian, he felt ought to be returned to Italy, the land of its production. This plea, strengthened to one of patriotic bitterness that rich Paris should not be decorated with the spoils of Italy robbed during the times of Napoleon, he maintained after his arrest. Geri sought counsel from Prof. Giovanni Poggi, director of the 
        Florence galleries. As a result of his conference, he answered the letter from Paris, entering heartily into the writer's proposals and sentiment, finally arranging a meeting in Italy, which took place at Florence on December 11, when the lost Mona Lisa was drawn from her hiding place under the false trunk bottom and returned to the world after her long seclusion. Nor has the Mona Lisa's smile lost aught of its subtlety.

        "Mona Lisa" Thief on Trial. Florence, Italy, June 4.—The trial of Vincenzo Perugia, on the charge of stealing Da Vinci's masterpiece, "Mona Lisa" from the Louvre in Paris, began here today. The disappearance of the picture on August 22, 1911, caused a sensation throughout the world, and search for it was not successful until December 12, 1913, when Perugia offered it for sale to a Florentine antiquarian. D. R. Analdi, an alienist, said at today’s hearing that Perugia was only partially responsible for his actions. Perugia did not deny that he had taken "Mona Lisa" from the Louvre. He said it was his desire to have it placed in the Palazza Degli Uffizi in Florence. Testimony as to the authenticity of the picture was given by several experts. Other witnesses gave evidence as to the details of the theft.

        MONA LISA'S STORY Return to Paris Recalls Long Misunderstood History. Salomon Reinach, a French Searcher for the Truth, Tells of His Efforts to Learn the Facts of Remarkable Portrait. Paris.—The unprecedented enthusiasm over the return of the Mona Lisa to Paris takes us back to the days of her first arrival, 400 years and more ago. Vincenzo Perugia, the Italian artisan, who abducted her from the Louvre in 1911 to "give her back" to Florence, is completely mistaken in his facts. Mona Lisa was always a Paris resident. At the moment when Perugia imagines her to have been "stolen" from Italy "by Napoleon," she had not been living in Italy for 300 years. Mona Lisa was brought to Paris by her father, Leonardo da Vinci, who sold her to King Francis I for $40,000 of our money—a terrific price in those days. When first exhibited in the palace of the Louvre 400 years ago there was a rush of all the
        notables of Paris to see her, comparable only to the present ovation of her return. Leonardo was the star guest of the French king, more run after and admired in Paris than in his native Italian city; and he could sell every scrap of his works. In his baggage when he came to France he brought the Mona Lisa. "Why does she smile so sadly?" asked the French king. Leonardo never told him. Yet he knew why. Why does Mona Lisa smile so sadly? Here at last is her true pathetic history. Now is the time to tell it. Mona Lisa has too long been misunderstood. "During 400 years past," says Paul Leprieur, curator of the Louvre paintings, who went to Italy and brought her back, "during 400 years past Mona Lisa has addled the wits of those who have talked about her after having looked too long upon her.”“Four centuries is rather much,” replies Salomon Reinach. This Salomon Reinach is the very type of the
        exact archaeologist. He will not permit geniuses to create facts, and is the enemy of wind and flapdoodle, breaking in on lofty theories with a marriage or death certificate. He is curator of the St. Germain museum, a remarkably distinguished man, perfectly well known in America. And Salomon Reinach pricked the bubble of all this wind about Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci took four years (1501–1504) to paint the wife of his friend, Francesco del Giocondo; and, so far from being in love with her or she with him, he dropped both portrait and sitter again and again, on a moment’s notice, to go on pleasure or business trips. Reinach is a terrible man. He chases a date through a hundred manuscripts until he traces it. Leonardo quit Florence in 1499, to return only in 1501. In 1502 he traveled in Umbria as architect of Valentine Borgia. He returned to Florence in 1503, went on a pleasure jaunt to 
        Venice in 1505, returned, and went to Milan in 1506. That is not four years of loving contemplation, is it? The truth is, that Leonardo painted the portrait gratis for his friend, the husband dropping in when business called. It bears every mark of such a non-paid, purely friendship portrait—to the last, in which the painter sells it to a third party. Salomon Reinach has found it. We know the melancholy of Mona Lisa. Married in 1496, she had no children until 1499. Then came a little daughter. Salomon Reinach remembered that once a librarian of Florence communicated to Muntz, the great French art historian, an extract from the ancient Libre del Morti—records of deaths in Florence. By this, it appears that on June 1, 1501, the little daughter (fanciulla) of Francesco del Giocondo and his wife Mona Lisa was buried from the church of Santa Maria Novella. Why, the very costume of Mona Lisa in the picture is heavy mourning! You see
        now. Her smile is a constrained smile, the best she can do to please the kindly painter who has paid singers, musicians, and buffoons to entertain her.

        Mona Lisa," The World's Finest Picture. The mysterious disappearance of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, the "Mona Lisa," or, as it is popularly known, "La Giocondo," from its place of honor in the Salon Carre of the Louvre, at Paris, caused consternation in the art world. The "Mona Lisa" is one of France's greatest art treasures, ranging with the sculptures "Venus de Milo" and "The Victory of Samothrace" and Murillo's painting, "The Immaculate Conception." It is held priceless. At one time it was reported that the British government offered $5,000,000 for the work. This offer was declined. It is the most celebrated portrait of a woman in the world. Da Vinci’s model was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a Florentine of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. When Da Vinci painted her, she was about thirty years old. The subject is shown seated in a low chair, on the left arm of which she is leaning. The gown is simple and
        drapes the figure in easy folds. Dark hair, hanging loosely, drapes an oval face with expressive eyes and aquiline nose. About the mouth is seen the sweet smile which has been the chief characteristic in making the painting famous. It is said that Da Vinci, in order to obtain this effect, had musicians, singers, and jesters near his subject to amuse her as he painted. The greater number of the comparatively few finished paintings left by Leonardo da Vinci have been lost. Of his masterpieces "The Last Supper," on a wall of the refectory in the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan, nothing remains but a few crumbling patches of color. This left the "Mona Lisa" the finest surviving example of one of the great masters of the high renaissance, and it is perhaps more famous than any other portrait in the world. Leonardo is said to have worked on the picture for four years (1500-1504). In July, 1910, it was reported on the 
        authority of the Cri de Paris that the Mona Lisa had been stolen from its frame to be sold to an American millionaire and a copy substituted. American art dealers were not incredulous and spoke of similar thefts from the Louvre in the past. The report was immediately followed by an official denial. Fears for the safety of the picture were always rife, and in 1907, when a young woman fanatic had slashed a picture by Ingres in the Louvre, the authorities put the Mona Lisa behind glass. There were instant protests from art lovers the world over, and the glass was removed. Last winter a controversy arose as to whether the Mona Lisa in the Louvre or a copy in the Prado at Madrid was the genuine picture. Spanish critics writing to the newspapers held that the genuine one was in the Prado. Dr. Wilhelm Bode, director of the Royal Museum at Berlin, appeared in print with a lengthy refutation of this claim. The only parallel with this 
        in the history of art thefts is the case of Gainsborough’s famous Duchess of Devonshire, which was taken from its frame in the showroom of an art firm in London some years ago, but later returned to its owners by the late Patrick F. Sheedy, a well-known American gambler, who acted as intermediary between the thief and the art dealers.

            How to Practice Yoga Bright sunshine pours into the room in which Mr. Dulin practices yoga himself. Windows on three sides and a skylight help to make the room cheerful, which he says adds greatly to the effect. In one corner is a small skeleton chair which he calls his yoga chair. It is straight-backed and would prove anything but comfortable for library use, but there is little chance of anyone letting his attention wander so far afield while sitting in it that he would fall asleep, in any sense of the term. For this reason, the chair is all the more valuable for the practice of yoga. Seated on this chair or standing, the practitioner goes through thirty minutes of concentrated mental and muscular exercises every morning and afternoon. These exercises consist largely of assuming more or less strained postures and in regulating the breath. Standing straight as a soldier on parade, Mr. Dulin illustrated the exercises. 
            Placing one hand over his right nostril, he drew in slowly a deep breath through his left nostril, rising on his toes as he did so. When he had filled his whole lungs, he closed the left nostril too and still on tiptoe held his breath for about thirty seconds. Then, opening his right nostril, he exhaled slowly. This exercise is repeated seven times, and then the breath is drawn in through the right nostril and exhaled through the left. Another exercise consists of rising on the toes and at the same time placing the outstretched arms above the head with hands clasped and also drawing a deep breath, which is held for a number of seconds. Still other breathing exercises are taken while sitting on the yoga chair. Breathing Affects Mental Activity."I drive each breath into every part of my body or into such part as my will designates," said Mr. Dulin. "My attention is concentrated directly upon what I am doing. The motion 
            of the lungs has a very intimate relation to the activity of the mind. If we control the motion of the lungs, the activity of the mind comes more easily under control. Conversely, if we control the activity of the mind, we can also control the motion of the lungs. When the motion of the lungs is brought under perfect control, every organ of the body is brought under the control of the spirit. Have you ever noticed that at the time of perfect concentration of mind the rhythm of respiration changes and gradually becomes slower and slower; perhaps it will almost cease for the time being. It has been said by a clever and experienced thinker, Dr. Lewes, that to acquire the power of attention is to learn to make our mental adjustments alternate with the rhythmic movements of respiration. How intimately breathing is connected with life is apparent to anyone who stops to think of the so-called phenomena of living. As soon as 
            breath ceases, the very body itself disintegrates. When supreme control over attention is acquired by voluntary effort, it is possible to fix one's attention on any part of the body and experience strange sensations and wonderful phenomena. It is a well-known fact that one can easily experience pain in any part of the body by merely fixing the attention upon that part. By an analogous process, one can get rid of pain in the body. Mental healers, many of whom surround their practices with all manner of mysticism, are familiar with such phenomena, although they fail to understand the true inwardness of their cures. One can cure disease by fixing attention on the diseased part and sending an opposite current of thought. This method has become a common practice with Christian Science healers, and other mental healers under a variety of names. But one thing should be remembered in this connection. It is that each individual
            is born with this kind of healing power himself or herself. No one can give you that power. It is one of the natural powers of the human mind. It is far better to heal yourself than to go to some other person for a cure, which, at best, is only temporary. Do not let your mind be controlled by any other mind. Men and women who go to mental healers or Christian Scientists for help and who allow themselves to be influenced by the minds of others, do not realize that, by allowing themselves to fall under the hypnotic power of stronger minds, they are walking in a path which leads to mental degeneration. Many cases have been known where minds have degenerated into the slaves of other minds, losing all power of self-control. How pitiable is the mental condition of these self-deluded ones. "Because a yogi comprehends this danger he never allows himself to be influenced by the minds of others. And for the same reason he is careful 
            about attempting a cure of his fellow-beings. While through perfect concentration it is possible to cure an ill person other than himself the yogi rarely attempts this, knowing the danger to which he is submitting his patient. Vedanta teaches the power which is latent in every human being for self-cure. We do, however, at times, and have done so in extreme cases such as fever. I could reduce a high fever by means of the power of concentration."But if yoga is rightly practiced it should prove a preventive rather than a cure for disease. Anyone who is practicing yoga daily should be in perfect health. It gives immunity from disease. Since I have practiced yoga I have never been ill for a moment. It hardens the physical body to such an extent that it can combat with ease the so-called germs of disease. What are germs? Anyway but the creation of the human mind? The invention of a human mind would be willing to eat all the 
            bacteria you bring me and feel no evil effect.""If that is the case and the whole human race should take up the practice of yoga the average age of man would be greatly advanced, would it not?" Mr. Dulin was asked."Undoubtedly," replied he. "The effect of yoga upon longevity is marked. Man should live to be 125 years old." Mr. Dulin has picked the age which the Russian scientist, Metchnikoff, selected for the average length of life of man. According to the Russian, however, man can attain this great age by living largely on buttermilk and a wonderful bacillus discovered by himself. Four Divisions of Yoga. There are four grand divisions of yoga, and each division is suited to a different tendency of mind. The first division of yoga is called Karma Yoga. It is for the active man, for those who like to work, the busy everyday workers in mankind. It is largely the science of physical culture. By this means the true science 
            of physical culture is reached. depends upon the concentration of the mind upon work in hand as well as the mere going through with certain exercises. Karma Yoga teaches the secret of work, and shows how to turn the daily tasks into acts of worship. Thus man may reach perfection of life through work and work alone. Bhakti Yoga is the name given to the second division. It is for such as are of an emotional nature. It teaches how ordinary emotions may bring forth a spiritual unfoldment of the highest kind and lead to the ultimate ideal of all religions. It explains the nature of divine love. The third division is Raja Yoga, which has to do with the whole realm of psychic phenomena. By its psychic powers are developed such as have astonished the world since the beginning of history, and which have been termed miracles by the uninitiated. This division includes the evolving of the fine perceptions, the projection out of the 
            body of the power of life, the curing of disease, and all the physical powers displayed by Jesus, and are in use by the Christian Scientists today. These phenomena have been known and understood by the yogis of India since ancient times. While Raja Yoga teaches all these psychic powers, it does not fail to warn its students that they are not the end of wisdom nor a sign of spirituality. "Little brains and weak intellects easily turn away from the path of spiritual truth when some psychic power begins to manifest itself," said Mr. Dulin. "They think they have reached the highest state of spirituality because they have the power of curing a headache." Jnana Yoga is the fourth division or method. It is for the intellectual discriminative and philosophical man. Value of Yoga in Business. "Of what tremendous value Yoga proves to business men can readily be understood aside from its spiritual value," continued Mr. Dulin. 
            "In these days of competition it is the man who can concentrate upon his work and perform it, shutting out all other interests, who goes to the front most rapidly. The practice of Yoga demands concentration and Concentration before everything. The habit of concentration grows greater as the practice of yoga continues. For example, I can today accomplish in a few hours what would have a few years ago required several days of hard work. Vedanta explains the true basis of ethics. Why should we be moral? Not because it is written in a certain chapter of a certain Scripture, but because of the spiritual oneness of the universe. When you realize that you are part and parcel of the whole creation, you know that if you injure others, you injure yourself, and no one gains anything to himself under such a belief. Vedanta believes that for the time being, at least, this is for his good. No criminal commits a crime without thinking 
            that he is to benefit thereby. Vedanta shows that because of this same spiritual oneness, we should love our neighbors as ourselves since in spirit we are already one. "Thirst for enjoyment is the real disease in us. Its various symptoms are passions, ambition, pride, jealousy, hatred, anger, and all the rest. Tremendous mental exertion of will power is often necessary to control the restless mind from taking the forms of waves of passion and anger. Perfect self-control of a yogi is that state of mind in which no desires or passions of any kind disturb the peace and tranquility of his soul. Such a state of mind can be acquired more easily by removing the bubbles of desires before they take the form of passion; that is, by attacking them while they are in their incipiency. By concentration and meditation upon the supreme truths, the desires may be brought under complete control."
            Vedanta teaches that the soul never dies, that the soul of each individual man is part of the divine power usually termed God. It teaches also that the soul of man will return to this earth in various incarnations, which represent the different stages of advance toward that perfection of being which is the true goal. Mr. Dulin said that the practice of yoga is materially aided by a vegetarian diet.

            MYSTERIOUS YOGA FAITH OF EAST INDIA WHICH HAS ROBBED AN AMERICAN CITIZEN OF A DEVOTED WIFE A Weird Religion. It is a weird religion, that of the Yogi, known in its generic form, but, in its many mysterious ramifications, regarded in awesome ignorance. That these fakirs do perform some wonders that not seem altogether inexplicable less, is attested by numerous reputable witnesses. But the power behind all this is still a mystery, clothed in the limitless shroud of occultism that only the East Indian can employ. To the Caucasian, the self-abnegation required to arrive at the perfect point that the Yogi assumes seems an impossibility of attainment. The marvelous concentration of will, it is said, makes the human brain capable of accomplishments. Yet the Yogi claims that they have gained mastery over this indomitable will forever, and, in this mastery, lies the power which enables them to govern natural laws, even to the 
            intangible law of gravitation. This power, which is in constant play, gives them control over the force of creation, the beginning of all being, and indeed, is a part of this faith. They believe that when man has gained his first purified form, and cast aside all grossness, he will return again to his original state. Belief of the Yogi The circle of existence runs unending and upon it rests the truth of all material and spiritual life. It is believed, therefore, that when their self-imposed trials of abnegation are performed stoically, they have gained their end, and are united in all respects to the Supreme Being, whom they worship. The main object of the Yogi is to establish a doctrine of a Supreme Being, and to teach the means by which the human soul may become permanently united with it. This Supreme Being is the reputed founder of the system, defined as a particular spirit who is untouched by affections, works the
            result of whose desires, in whom the germ of omnipotence reaches its supreme limit, and who is the preceptor of even the first because he is not limited by time. His appellation is Om. To attain the consciousness which leads to union of the soul with the Supreme Being, eight stages are taught. These are: moral and religious rectification, posture regulation of the breath, restraint, fixation, and profound contemplation. Self-Control and Religion. The first stage, self-control, consists in not doing injury to living beings, veracity, avoidance of theft, chastity, and non-acceptance of gifts. The second stage, religious observance, comprises external, as well as internal purity, contentment, austerity, muttering of the Vedic hymns, and devoted reliance on the Supreme Being. The third stage of Yoga, postures of various sorts, is regarded as essential to those following. The fourth stage, regulation of the breath, is three-fold,
            according as it concerns exhalation and inhalation, or becomes tantamount to the suspension of the breath. The fifth stage, the strength of the senses, means the diversion or withdrawal of the senses from their respective objects, and their entire accommodation to the nature of the mind. This stage is preparatory to the sixth, or the steadying of the mind, which means the freeing of the mind from any sensual disturbance by fixing the thoughts upon some part of the body, usually the tip of the nose. Meditation and Contemplation. Meditation, the seventh stage, is the fixing of the mind on the one object of knowledge, the Supreme Being, to the exclusion of all other thoughts. The eighth, or last stage, profound contemplation, is the perfect absorption of thought into the object, the Supreme Being; it is devoid of all thoughts and meditations. In such a state, a Yogi is insensible to heat and cold, to pleasure and pain; he has
            the same prosperity and adversity; he amends in ascetic reduction. The last three stages are generalized again, because upon their perfection depend the wonderful results which are promised to those who apply them to the extreme. Such results are, for example, the knowledge of the past and future, the knowledge of the sounds of all creatures, the knowledge of what has happened in one's former births, of the thoughts of others, and the length of the human frame; the power of levitation, the overcoming of hunger and thirst, death at will, and the creation of all that exists in the different worlds; and an analysis of the structure of one's own body. Their Eight Great Powers. There are eight great powers which a Yogi will accomplish when properly regulating his knowledge—the power of shrinking into the form of the minutest atom, of becoming extremely light, of becoming extremely heavy, of unlimited reach of the organs, of 
            irresistible will, of obtaining perfect dominion over everything, of changing the course of nature, and, lastly, of going anywhere at will. If the Yogi apply his knowledge to the contemplation of the smallest division of time and the successive order in which such divisions occur, he makes a discrimination which enables him to understand the subtle elements and to pass into the infinite. When his intellect has become free from passion he knows neither friend nor enemy, and no longer is subject to the result of acts performed, and when both have thus obtained the same degree of purity, the Yogi obtains eternal liberation. This is the religion that Mrs. Stead has adopted. But enough of technicalities. In practical demonstrations the Yogis have made their faith stand the world’s amazement. And their demonstrations are of remarkable puzzles and marvels. The existence of God, as realized by them, is a matter of absolute 
            demonstration—the forbidden fruit of the perfect man, and an element of life itself, as is oft witnessed frequently by foreigners. Yogi named Govinda-Swami, on the terrace of his own house. Being by no means credulous, Jacolliot took every precaution to prevent deception. Fine sand was strewn on the ground in order to make as even a surface as possible. The justice was asked to seat himself at a table, upon which was a pencil and paper. The fakir carefully laid a piece of wood upon the sand, and announced that whatever figures Jacolliot might draw on the paper would be transcribed precisely upon the sand by the piece of wood. The Yogi stretched out his hand, and the wooden piece immediately copied upon the sand the most complicated and twisted figures that Jacolliot drew. When the Frenchman stopped writing, the piece of wood also came to a standstill. Read Words in His Mind. The fakir stood at a distance against a 
            wall, while the justice held the paper and pencil in such a way that the Indian could not possibly see what he was writing. Finally, the Indian asked Jacolliot to think of some words in Sanskrit, whereupon the piece of wood instantly traced n the sand the very words that were in the justice's mind. The fakir next stretched out his hand toward a huge bronze vase, filled with water, and weighing several hundred pounds. In five minutes the vase began to move, approaching the fakir with a slow, regular motion. When the distance between the vase and the paper had been considerably diminished, the vase began to emit loud, metallic sounds, as if struck with an iron rod. Occasionally, the noise would resemble the roar of a fire. At Jacolliot's request, the fakir made the vase stop, move, and stop again. Then, Jacolliot demanded that the metal tones should sound again at the end of ten seconds, and the phenomenon was repeated 
            at the exact moment, which he noted by his own watch. He asked that the sounds should keep time to the tune of a music box, which he wound up for the purpose. This requirement, too, was fulfilled. Buried For Three Months. Other demonstrations of the Yoga, even more startling and seemingly more impossible, have been recorded. Sir Claude Wade, in company with several English army officers, witnessed a demonstration at Lahore, India, that even more fully demonstrated the power of the fakir to suspend life in his own body. This fakir was buried quite naturally in a grave dug for the purpose, and the earth was piled in upon him. Sir Claude took every precaution against the body being disturbed, keeping a guard about the grave constantly. At the expiration of three months, the time specified for the end of the demonstration, he superintended the disinterment of the man, who, when the earth had been removed, walked from the 
            grave alive and well. During the interim, he had been hermetically sealed, and had had nothing to eat or drink, thus proving beyond the question of a doubt, his ability to suspend breathing and animation at will. Other Demonstrations. Other familiar demonstrations of the Yogi are the throwing of a rope into the air, the demonstrator climbing up to an invisible height, finally vanishing completely; the appearance and disappearance of the operator at will before his audience; the ability to withstand the application of hot irons and sword thrusts with seeming indifference, and the control that enables him to pose for hours at a time in an apparently cramped condition without the movement of a muscle.

            The larger part of the mental energy of the majority of people in this country is needlessly wasted by the constant rush of their daily lives, which is merely the result of a lack of self-control. The secret revealed by Karma Yoga teaches how to avoid this waste and also the nervous disorders which are the outcome. "Then comes Bhakti Yoga. I find not only your women but also the men, the business and professional men, much in need of this teaching. It is for those of an emotional nature. It is the path of devotion and love. It teaches how to fulfill the purpose of life both here and in the hereafter. "The third is Raja Yoga, the path of concentration and meditation. This field covers the whole psychic plane and describes the processes by which the psychic powers are developed, such as thought reading, clairvoyance, clairaudience, the evolving of finer perceptions, the going out of the body, the curing of disease 
            through mental power. Everything taught in such kindred treatments as mental healing, Christian Science, the Emmanuel movement has been taught as one element of a great whole for generation after generation by the believers and followers of the Vedanta. "Displayed by Jesus of Nazareth and which are used today by the so-called new sects have been an open book for years to the Yogis or wise men of India. Christian Science, the new Emmanuel, can give us nothing new. But we do not overemphasize peculiar cult; we do not believe in the constant obsession of the mind by the thought of disease, even though the healing of the disease is the ultimate reason for that obsession. "It is in Raja Yoga that the wonderful system of breathing is taught, whose effects are not unknown to the mental healers of the West, but it does not cease to warn its students that the attainment of any of these powers is not a sign of spirituality.
            "Jnana Yoga is the fourth method. It is the path of right knowledge and discrimination. It is for those who are of a philosophic nature. It explains the fundamental principles of spiritualism, tells us how the soul exists after death and under what conditions, describes how the earthbound are reincarnated, taking human form again and again. It expounded the law of correspondences ages before Swedenborg was born." The only other resident swami at the Vedanta society at present besides Swami Paramananda is Swami Abhedananda, who delivers a special course of lectures during the winter and holds the Yoga classes for members only.

             A PAGE HOW YOUNG GIRLS STUDY THE FOR HINDOO METHOD OF REST AND RELAXATION THAT there is a great deal of good in the old Hindu philosophy of rest and relaxation is a truth that has again been demonstrated by recent happenings. One of these is the fact that many young girls, girls as young as 10 or 12 years of age, find it necessary to rest from school work or mental and physical exertion of any kind, temporarily, and take a rest cure, just as the jaded society woman withdraws from her social activities to recuperate, and during the retirement they are taught the value of absolute relaxation. The other is that, simultaneously with the scientific study of rest and relaxation by the young girl of today, the Yogi treatment and philosophy are brought into prominence by the leaders in the Emmanuel movement who rely upon this old Hindu method for restoring the mind and body to a natural and healthful condition. Yogi breathing,
            Yogi physical exercises and Yogi philosophy of relaxation are made a feature of the practical side of the Emmanuel treatment of certain cases, and this form of treatment is proved to be so beneficial in restoring wasted mental and physical force that the method is now being applied to young persons, the idea being that the sooner a girl learns how to rest and relax scientifically the stronger will be her vitality and the better will be her ability to withstand the strain that modern life puts upon the individual. It is not because girls are breaking down earlier or are showing a loss of nervous force at a younger age than formerly that they are being taught how to take care of themselves after the oriental fashion, but because parents and guardians see that it is important to them to learn as early as possible the value of this quaint and simple philosophy which has been practiced centuries upon centuries and has brought
            about excellent results. The difficulty experienced by a grown person in learning to relax properly and to rest perfectly is multiplied by that person's years. It follows quite naturally, then, that the earlier one begins studying this science the easier it comes to one and the greater are its advantages all during life. Besides the beneficial effects derived from the practice of Hindu philosophy and physical exercises the idea of the science can not fail to appeal to the young girl. The principle of the treatment is simple to understand and the rules are easy to follow, while the results are almost always immediate enough to be encouraging and to stimulate interest in the cult. One of the hardest things to do is to relax completely. Some persons think they are letting go of their muscles, but in reality they are not. Instead, the grip of their muscles is tense and it is almost impossible for them to relax even after a 
            series of mental and physical treatment. Relaxing is partly mental, so that youthful minds are easier to grasp this idea than grown persons. AMONG the best relaxing exercises are those which start with the body standing and letting go of each muscle and joint separately. First the arms are outstretched in front and the fingers are permitted to drop, to fall of themselves, and when they are perfectly limp and inactive then the relaxing should be continued to the forearm, then to the upper arm, letting the whole arm drop loosely at the side and not only remain motionless but possess the sensation of utter relaxation. These exercises in letting go of the tension of the muscles should be continued to the feet, then the legs, the pupil lifting and dropping each one in turn; then to the shoulders and the head by letting the latter fall loosely as it will either in front or to one side and the whole pupil relax the body "slumping"
            forward. Even the waist and the hips can be relaxed, although the loosening of the tension will be less noticeable. Now, after the various muscles have been taught what perfect relaxation means and this is only the beginning of the treatment—lie down on a couch or a bed that is not too soft and let go of the entire body, supplementing the physical relaxation with a mental attention to these muscles and members of the body. The Hindu maintains that the mind must be fixed on the muscle relaxation in order to get the best results and to make the "letting go" thorough and complete, especially when one is learning the first principles of relaxing. Resting like this once or twice during the day will restore one quickly to normal condition, and a few minutes devoted to perfect relaxation are worth an hour or more of sleep of the ordinary kind. It sounds more or less absurd to one who does not understand the art and science of 
            relaxation and perfect rest to say that one's energy and vitality can be restored without having the pupil lie down. The method to pursue in this quick restoration process is to think of oneself in their active position; that is, with the head up, shoulders back and chest expanded slightly. The arms should be allowed to drop loosely at the sides. While in this position the body on the balls of the feet, lifting the heels gradually and throwing them back to the floor. the weight forward, with the body still held erect and not tilted forward. As the heels rise the arms should be lifted straight out at the sides and upward until they pass above the horizontal line. Breathe deeply as the arms ascend, then hold the position for a minute or so and gradually let the heels drop down and the arms fall limply at the sides, not forgetting to exhale slowly and evenly as the original position is resumed. PROPER breathing has quite as
             much to do with the success of the relaxing and the muscle exercises as the movements themselves. One can fall into what approaches a mesmerized state just by breathing in the oriental fashion and continuing the action for a few minutes. While lying flat on your back raise the right hand to the nostrils, and with the finger or the thumb close one side tightly, making it necessary to breathe through the other. Rhythmical breathing is essential to perfect repose. With the hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through the right side and exhaling through the left, then reversing the order by closing the other side. Instead of expanding the chest first as you breathe try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continuing the reclining position and alternating the nostrils as inhalers and exhalers. Then begin by taking a deep breath from deep down in the abdominal region, gradually inflating the other parts of the chest
            and lungs as the breathing is continued on up to the very tops of the lungs. In this way the abdomen, chest, and even the upper section of the lungs or the collarbone are raised and expanded with the air. Hold it a few seconds, then exhale by first drawing in the abdomen, then dropping the lower part of the chest and finally allowing the upper part to fall as much as possible breathing is essential to perfect repose. With the hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through the right side and exhaling through the left, then reversing the order by closing the other side. Instead of expanding the chest first as you breathe, try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continuing the reclining position and alternating the nostrils as inhalers and exhalers. Then begin by taking a deep breath from deep down in the abdominal region, gradually inflating the other parts of the chest and lungs as the breathing is continued on up 
            to the very tops of the lungs. In this way the abdomen, chest, and even the upper section of the lungs or the collarbone are raised and expanded with the air. Hold it a few seconds, then exhale by first drawing in the standing position, with the feet spread a little apart, heels almost touching, head up, shoulders back, chest expanded and the abdomen drawn in. This is the way to start. Then, if you want to begin with an easy exercise, stretch the arms forward in front, keeping them level with the shoulders, and with the palms of the hands pressed together gently, not rigidly, swing the arms back, keeping them on the same horizontal plane until they are as far back of the shoulders as they will go. At first you will not be able to touch the backs of the hands, but after a little practice this will come quite readily. Do this quickly backward and forward for 10 times and then see how much better the muscles of the back feel 
            and how much easier it is to stand erect.

            POsition Is Everything in Life to Yogi Practitioners By B.K. Tiwari. NEW DELHI (UPI)—Ancient Hindu saints, it is believed here, lived as long as 2000 years. They then went to heaven, traveled through hell, explored space and returned to earth to tell their people all about those regions. Their secret was "Yoga"—the Indian way of controlling mind and body.Rishis (saints) Brataharti, Markandeya, the Saptarishi brothers and Narad are some notable legendary figures who lived a world life for as much as 2000 years and then left for a heavenly abode at their will. "Yoga" is a comprehensive term which embodies a number of postures called "asans." These "asans" are dependent upon the physiology of the body and its muscular and nervous systems. The "Yoga" system has three divisions, Karma Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Gyan Yoga. Karma Yoga is practiced to achieve peace of mind while living in this world. Its best exposition is found in the Gita,
            the Hindus' holy bible. Hatha Yoga has preventive as well as curative qualities for all ailments, Hindus believe. Perfection in this Yoga system would make a man capable of living in any climatic conditions without any difficulty. Deep breathing and meditation are the essence of Yoga. Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter Indira practice part of Hatha Yoga. Nehru now no longer stands on his head. But he does deep breathing almost every day. Hatha Yoga is regarded as a prime Yoga effort which gradually comes to be the methodical approach to the attainment of the highest in the Yoga. Hatha Yoga accepts man for what he really is. It therefore does not neglect the physical aspect of a person's life. Yoga experts recommend Hatha Yoga for space flights among other things. Gyan Yoga is the highest form of Yoga. By achieving perfection in this branch, according to Hindus, a person can leave his body at will, travel as far as he likes and then re-enter his body.

            ¿Qué Es El Yoga? Yoga es una palabra sánscrita que significa literalmente unión, aunque también tiene las acepciones de “contemplación” y “concentración”. Por yoga se comprende el método que ha de seguir el hombre para llegar a la mística unión con Dios. Los indúistas reconocen varias clases de yoga: los yoga de sabiduría, donde se logra la liberación por medio de la comprensión, conocimientos y sabiduría adquiridos por el ejercicio de la razón pura. La Yoga-Raja, o yoga mental que consiste en el dominio de la mente y del cuerpo mediante la actuación de la voluntad, de acuerdo con ciertos métodos, como el de la respiración rítmica. La Yoga-Karma, o yoga de acción que consiste en la realización de buenas obras. La Yoga-Bhakti o devocional que consiste en el sincero anhelo de la unión amorosa con el infinito, es una yoga mística donde se pide a Dios amor y devoción pero se abstienen de pedir favores y merecedes personales como hacemos nosotros con nuestros santos. 
            Hay además el Hatha-yoga, que es muy susceptible de perversión pues suele conducir a la magia negra a los espíritus pusilánimes.

            Con la Práctica del Yoga se Puede Vivir Muchos Años Más El Karma Yoga, el Hatha Yoga y el Gyan Yoga — Peligroso si se Experimenta Equivocadamente Los antiguos santos hindúes vivían hasta 2,000 años. Estaban en el cielo, recorrían los infiernos, rondaban por el espacio y regresaban a la tierra para contarle todo a la gente. Su secreto era el Yoga, la manera india de controlar la mente y el cuerpo. Los Rishis (santos) Bratahari, Markandeya Saptarishi y Narad son algunas de las figuras legendarias que vivieron una vida terrestre durante 2,000 años y luego la dejaron, por la celestia, por su propia voluntad. "Yoga" es un término amplio que comprende una cantidad de posturas llamadas “Asans.” Estas “Asans” dependen de la fisiología del cuerpo y su sistema muscular y nervioso. El sistema "Yoga" tiene tres divisiones, el Karma Yoga, el Hatha Yoga y el Gyan Yoga. El Karma Yoga se practica para lograr la paz de la mente en este mundo. Su mejor exposición se encuentra en el Gita, la biblia de los hindúes. El Hatha Yoga tiene cualidades curativas,
            así como preventivas, para todos los males. La perfección en este sistema yoga, haría a un hombre capaz de vivir en cualquier condición climática sin dificultad alguna. La respiración profunda y la meditación constituyen la esencia del yoga. El Primer Ministro de India, Jawaharlal Nehru, y su hija, Indira, practican parte del Hatha Yoga. Nehru no se pone cabeza abajo, pero hace aspiraciones profundas todos los días. Se considera el Hatha Yoga como un esfuerzo primario que, gradualmente, llega a reconocerse en el acercamiento a la perfección de la mente

            Love Tangles Too, Too Solid Even for Yoga Mrs. Florence Street could not get her husband, Robert A. Street, wealthy radio executive, to take his meals regularly. Then, as if that were not enough, Mrs. Edith Street lived in despair because she could not account for a series of strange happenings. At least, according to Mrs. Street, when Robert Street got a notion to judge her mental equilibrium, he did it in a way that seemed to defy all reason. “Yoga,” he explained, is that mystic philosophy of the East, whose exponents rise to triumph in all kinds of weird feats, such as attitude making themselves invisible. Yogis, as the practitioners of Yoga are called, eat carrots, stand on their heads and squat. Learning that Robert had acquired his taste for these activities at the exquisite feet of Miss Barnes, his wife went into a New York court and charged as much. She said he’d told her that Yogi High Priestess Carman had given him “new life, new love, new hope and a complete new cycle”—by which he did not mean a bicycle. He meant a life cycle, 
            which is something you have over and over again, like the common cold. Her testimony won Mrs. Street a new separation and new alimony. Robert, meanwhile, had skipped out to Reno and won himself a full-dress divorce. At least, it was full-dress everywhere but in New York. There, the courts considered his wife’s suit the more formal, so his was fruitless. Mr. Street was dissatisfied, as a consequence, and it seems a fair surmise that Mrs. Street was a little dissatisfied, too. Whether or not she then proceeded to work off her Yoga-bred dissatisfaction by getting another woman's husband to do things he hadn’t done before is a question which Mrs. Edith Marko now has asked the New York courts to pass upon. If the answer is “Yes,” as Mrs. Marko believes, then she will win a separation from her Robert, plus $500 a week alimony and $5,000 for her lawyers. Mrs. Marko's description of Mrs. Street is scarcely that of a wife unable to hold a husband. She calls her, "A Jezebel, a Lorelei, full of guile, who sings songs of love, making foolish men mad with desire."
            Curiously enough, the incident which allegedly showed Mrs. Street in her new colors was precipitated not by Mrs. Marko but by Mr. Street, who all this time has been biding his time, dissatisfied. The detectives, who raided her Bucks County, Pa., retreat a while ago, were his detectives. And, as they walked into the house, they testified, down the stairs came the lady of the house and Mrs. Marko’s Robert, convivially wearing bathrobes. Mrs. Street and Mr. Marko, for their part, assert that they weren’t there to play, but to write a play. After kindly turning over his alleged findings to Mrs. Marko, so she could start suing, Mr. Street started suing again himself, in the New York courts this time. He asked for a divorce, and if not that an annulment, and if not THAT at least a separation.

           THE VELOCIPEDE. “Nothing is at once invented and perfected,” says an old Latin maxim, the truth of whose application was made manifest in the early history of the velocipede. Like all things on earth it was forty years in the wilderness. It first made its appearance in Paris and received notice of the following effect in the Courier de Paris. The date of the extract was July 25, 1789: “It was stated that a certain vehicle, invented by M. M. Blanchard and Massaurier—the former the celebrated aeronaut—was exhibited in rapid motion in the Place Louis XII. on July 27, 1789, in presence of many members of the French academy and a large concourse of spectators. At the front of the machine was the head of an eagle with outspread wings, to which was attached the apparatus with which the driver directed its movements. Behind him was seated an individual who gave an impetus, more or less rapid, to the machine by pressing his feet alternately on the ground. He sat down or stood at discretion, with his legs half concealed in a sort of box, where the springs that communicated
           movement to the machine were evidently placed. The vehicle was subsequently transported to Versailles, and exhibited its capabilities in presence of Louis XVI, Maria Antoinette and their court. There is nothing to show why this experiment failed, but it is to be supposed that it had its defects.” The second appearance was also in 1808, and public exhibitions were made of its workings in the Jardin du Luxembourg, but without success. At that time it was mounted on very low wheels, and the rider had to support himself by placing his feet directly on the ground. Such a mechanism was of course rudimentary, and the result was that the invention was extensively ridiculed and caricatured, and in these archives only do any traces of the first experiments made with this machine in the garden of Luxembourg exist. But the modern railroad locomotive was also sneered at and caricatured, and so was the modern steamboat. And the early inventors, who sought to make the world wiser, were called disciples of the black art, and friends of the devil. And more, they were socially 
           ostracized; they were hooted at and stoned by the mob, and sometimes burned at the stake. But they never ceased scheming and planning, nor was the velocipede to stop here. Twenty years after its first exhibition the velocipede reappeared in Paris. This time, a public functionary, one M. Dreuze, perfected the machine of twenty years before, and again exhibited it in its improved form. M. Dreuze secured the rider’s point of support upon the axletrees to the two wheels instead of the ground, and thus created the actual modern velocipede. The inventor, who belonged to the administration of postoffices, also formed the further idea of proposing this machine for the use of rural postmen, as being of greater availability in the matter of speed and promptness, and at the same time causing them less The plan was adopted, but unfortunately, just in the winter season, when many difficulties existed in the way of locomotion. The wheels slipped about in the mud, and plans were frustrated, and the enterprise was again considered a failure. At this late date, it would have 
           been suggested that it was only necessary to iron the wheels or suspend the use of the velocipede during the winter; but the French Government lacks invention and dropped the velocipede. “Three times and out,” is the old saying, but not so with our subject. A few years on, and, undiscouraged, the velocipede appeared a third time, and again in an altered form—this time being a little carriage upon three wheels and propelled by the hands of the rider. This machine did not succeed on account of the difficulty in guiding it and the fatigue it caused the guider. It is a well-known fact that the muscles of the legs can be used much longer than those of the arms, and, acting upon this hint, all good velocipedes are so arranged that the action of the arms is merely complimentary to that of the legs. This failure was the result of not attending to this fact. “The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.” Science and improvement move like the tortoise, but still, they move, as Galileo said of the world. When a pebble is dropped in the water your 
           eye loses the ripple. But that little splash has displaced every drop in the stream, and the water you see before you has been completely changed. The velocipede as it has been exhibited thus far was an idea dropped into the mud, and that idea must grow, and the mind must be revolutionized before its work ends. In the presence of success who is so bold as to laugh. Ridicule falls harmless before the iron armor of prosperity. And the velocipede succeeded. Paris, where it was hooted at and frowned down, now lifts up the prostrate work, and the thing despised yesterday is the idol worshipped to-day. It is the poetry of justice, and the two share the triumph. The thoroughfares of Paris are thronged with countless riders on the strange creature, and the public have warned the velocipede votaries that they must carry their lanterns on their vehicles to avoid accidents. The mania has spread to all classes, and to the suburban cities of the capital. In St. Cloud, Vincennes, Engheim, Pantim; in Bordeaux, Marseilles, and the other principal cities, the people are all 
           riding this economical species of iron horse, which requires no feed, harness, stable, or groom to care for it. The velocipede and velocipede mania has reached America. It struck New Orleans many years ago. But the inhabitants of that benighted burg thought it might be the "yellow jack" in disguise, and gave it the cold shoulder. Time passed, and all Europe was ablaze with enthusiasm and astride of their favorite Philadelphia, stand and quakerish, has adopted the velocipede with but little less enthusiasm than New York. Jersey is practicing, and so are the swells and the broadcloth fractions of the rectangular city bid fair to rival New York in their exhibition of the new order of equestrianism. Chicago, as in all things, rides velocipedes are becoming a matter of every day occurrence on our streets. Our tradesmen and mechanics are beginning to lay them in for sale. The fever is catching, by the time the season opens we will see them coming among our regular institutions. If they are to prove a success, there is no city and surrounding country better adapted 
           for them than this is; a city perfectly flat, and a surrounding country equally flat, are elements for the use of this machine best calculated to test its merits. Chicago, as is her wont, is not to be beaten even in velocipedes, and comes to the rescue with a machine which differs from any other extant, not only in its general appearance, but in its motive power. This Chicago velocipede has three wheels, two behind and one in front. The hind wheels are considerably the largest, being four feet and two inches in diameter, while the front wheel is only two feet and one-half. The front wheel is for the purpose of guiding the machine, and is connected by a lever with the body, and reaching within convenient distance of the seat, a straddle runs up from the axle of the front or guiding wheel, about a foot from the tire, which surmounted by a lamp. This velocipede is propelled by spring-power, which works as follows: On the axle of the hind wheels is fastened a pinion, which is operated upon by a cog wheel, five times its size in diameter. Fastened to each side of 
           this large cog-wheel is a dog, which works into a ratchet, upon the hub of which ratchet is fastened the center of the springs. The other end of the spring is fastened to a rod of iron, which runs through the body of the velocipede. These springs are made of the very best English spring steel, two inches wide, one-tenth of an inch thick, and nine feet long, and when wound up their power is estimated at over 3,000 pounds each. Immediately outside of the spring, and in the ratchet hub, is fastened one of the treadles. The large cog-wheel and ratchet work loose around the shaft on which they are placed. The treadles are two feet long, and reach from the ratchet shaft to within convenient distance for the foot of a person occupying the seat. On the end of each treadle is a slipper to keep the foot from being shoved forward. By an ingenious contrivance the wheels can be thrown out of gear, so that the velocipede, even under full headway, can be turned around within a space of fourteen feet. The seat has the appearance and general characteristics of a buggy seat, 
           and can carry two persons with ease. It was designed for the use of ladies only, but can be used by anybody. The grand feature of this Chicago velocipede is, that it is worked by spring power, and that the springs can be perpetually wound up by simply using the treadles after ately. It only takes one-fourth the power to wind the springs that the springs exert in unwinding. By pressing upon the treadle with the foot the ratchet is turned, on which is placed the spring, which of course is thereby wound. It differs from the Alton invention in this, that the springs are being continuously wound by the alternate treadles, and this can always be kept in motion; while the Alton invention runs only a mile and then stops to be wound again. This Chicago invention has been tested and all who have seen it are sanguine of its success. The cost of one of these machines will be about $100. Velocipedes are of various kinds. Some have two, and others three, and even four wheels; all have either pedals or rests on which to place the feet, and usually either brakes or levers to 
           regulate the speed.THE TWO-WHEEL VELOCIPEDES. The two wheeled velocipedes, or the bicycles as they are styled, are intended for the male sex only, and are by far the swiftest machines. They are usually of wrought iron, and have pedals or reels attached to the front and large wheel, and the working of these gives a light movement of the feet and the requisite impulse to the vehicle. The saddle is placed upon a bar of iron, suspended four inches above the top of the fore wheel. The hands rest on a handle in front of the machine, which, working on a pivot, serves as a balancing pole, and equilibrium is preserved by exercising a slight twist to this handle. By this means the rider stops the revolving motion of THE THREE-WHEEL VELOCIPEDES. The three-wheel velocipede, or tricycle, is easier to guide and safer to use than the bicycle. Its speed, however, is less rapid; still, it can be made to pass a carriage at full trot. As the fair sex largely patronize the tricycle, the seat is more commodious than that of the bicycle, having sides and backs of wicker, and a horse 
           hair cushion to sit upon. The hind wheels, though large, are light, and revolve with facility. The fore wheel, which is smaller, serves to guide the machine, being acted upon by means of the handle, which causes it instantly to turn in the direction indicated by the rider. The pedals are shaped like slippers, which facilitate the movement of the legs, and at the same time admit of the foot being disengaged instantaneously. The movement required to impel the machine is a perfectly natural one, analogous to that of walking. That is, it requires but the slightest pressure of the foot, and produces no unusual fatigue to the leg. In addition to these advantages, the largest three-wheeled velocipedes have carriers attached to the pedals and fit on the axles. By this means the speed of the vehicle is considerably increased, and the pressure of the foot is relieved by transmitting the motion to the driving apparatus of the machine by means of impulse and a brake.

            ROGER MOTORCYCLE. It Left New York Yesterday on Its Journey to Chicago. NEW YORK, Nov. 15.—At 12:15 o’clock today the new Roger motorcycle left on its 900-mile journey to Chicago. The motorcycle is the same as the horseless carriage, which has caused so much interest all over the country. This is the longest trip that has ever been attempted by a motorcycle in this country. The carriage in which the trip is being made is patterned after the phaeton and is run by the Benz naphtha motor. The carriage has no baggage other than the two men who are attending to it and forty gallons of naphtha. The carriage will run during the daylight hours, and at night the travelers will rest wherever darkness overtakes them. It is expected that the carriage will reach Chicago next Saturday evening.

            SPORTS AND RECREATION THE WORLD OF SPORTS. POLO—CHESS—ATHLETICS. R. G. Betts’s Services to Motorcycling—The Kennel Show. One of the most active workers among motorcyclists is R. G. Betts, the president of the Federation of American Motorcyclists. Mr. Betts was recently elected to this office. The purpose of the organization is to "encourage the use of motorcycles and to promote the general interests of motorcycling; to ascertain, defend, and protect the rights of motorcyclists; to facilitate touring; to assist in the good roads movement and to advise and assist in the regulation of motorcycle racing and other competitions in which motorcycles engage." He became interested in motorcycles while living in Boston in 1900, his first experience gained on a rented tricycle. In August of that
            year he sought to organize the first motorcycle club, and issued a call to bring together some fourteen interested men. The group, away from its stated purpose, and, against Mr. Betts’s protest, resolved itself into a national organization styled the Associated Motorcyclists. Mr. Betts is a native of New York and has been connected with bicycle journals for many years. He is now the editor of the motor and motorcycle publications published by the Goodwin Company. He is a member of the New York Motorcycle Club and the Alpha Motorcycle Club and was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Cycling Club. He is also a delegate of the Associated Cycling Clubs. There is much interest in the Election Day races to be held at the Meadow Brook Club, on the Hempstead Plains. There will be five races,
            gentlemen riders competing.

            MOTORCYCLES FOR POLICE. Machines Now Being "Tried Out" for Selection for a Squad. Through certain motorcycle riders and dealers it is reported that New York, or at least Manhattan borough, is to have a motorcycle police squad. Inspector Smith, it is said, has become a convert to the idea ever since the general adoption, about a year ago, of the "grip control," which enables a rider to start and stop and regulate his speed on one of the power cycles with one hand and without removing it from the steering bar. A number of members of the New York Motorcycle Club and several dealers have been interviewed by the inspector, with a view to selecting the best make of machine, and several varieties have been tried out on the road by officers. Two patrolmen are now covering posts on motorcycles, 
            Patrolman Ennis, on Riverside Drive, being one of them. According to Inspector Smith the only thing that stands in the way of an immediate formation of a motorcycle squad is lack of funds. He considers the machines necessary for chasing automobiles and runaways, and he hopes to be able to get the money for them before long.

       MOTORCYCLISTS AFTER RECORDS. FAST MACHINES IN RACES AT AGRICULTURAL PARK. DE ROSIER, THE INDIAN RIDER, NOT ENTERED TODAY. Derkum on Thor Reeled Off Miles Close to 56 Seconds Yesterday, in Tryouts—Breeze Goes in 58 on Indian. BY FREDERIC PABST World's records will be shattered at Agricultural Park this afternoon when the crack motorcyclists of the west meet in fourteen different events. The speedy little two-wheelers have been tuned up to the second and will be out today to cut down existing records, and judging from the time made yesterday the fastest miles ever seen on a local track will result. All of the events are well filled and much interest is being shown in the races. The following is the program of events: Race No. 1—Five miles, fully equipped stock machines, single cylinder, 
       under 50 cu. in. Prize, $30, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 2—Five miles, fully equipped stock machines, twin cylinder, under 60 cu. in. Prize, $30, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 3—Five miles, Club challenge cup for single cylinders, for club members only owning machines 15 days old. Race No. 4—Five miles, Club challenge cup for multiple cylinders, for club members only owning machines 15 days old. Race No. 5—Man against motorcycle, 100 yards. Prize, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 6—Five miles, free for all, single cylinder machines. Prize, $20, $10, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 7—Five miles, free for all, multiple cylinder machines. Prize, $20, $10, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 8—Fifteen mile limit, Australian pursuit race, free for all, single cylinder machines. Prize, $25, $15, $5 in merchandise.
       Race No. 9—Fifteen mile limit, Australian pursuit race, free for all, multiple cylinder machines. Prize, $25, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 10—Ten mile professional, open.

Prize, $25, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 12—Trials for world’s record, both professional and amateur. Race No. 13—Five miles, Riders challenge cup, for multiple cylinder machines under 60 cu. in. Race No. 14—One hour race, free for all. Prize, beautiful cup. The track was alive with speeding machines yesterday and the trials went off without an accident of any kind. A force of police kept the people off the course to prevent a repetition of the unfortunate 
       occurrence of the day previous. The fastest work yesterday was done by Paul Derkum on a “Thor.” He went close to 56 seconds for the mile, and says he will reach that mark in the contest today. Ben Brees did some fast riding on an Indian. He went around the circle in 58 seconds. Others who went close to the minute mark were John Derkum, W. Hose and G. Blaylock, these latter on single cylinder machines. The track is in the best of shape and there is every reason to expect the fastest time. Jake De Rosier, the well-known Indian rider, will not appear. He was talked of on all sides as Derkum’s one opponent to be feared, but he has not been entered, and C.W. Risden, the local Indian agent, says he never expected him to be here for the contests. The statement that De Rosier would race here was unauthorized, according to Risden.
       Risden said last night that his fastest Indian machine was put out of commission in the tryouts Monday. Brees had gone to the track without sufficient oil, and a piston stuck, putting the car out of the running. There are fifteen entries in the five-mile free-for-all for one-cylinder machines. Four Thors, a Merkel, three Indians, two Reading Standards, two Ives, and H-D's, a Harley Davidson and Peugeot will do battle. All the crack riders are entered to ride, including Derkum, Wilson, Hoag, Knapp, Richardson and Seymour. The one-hour race will be a hummer. Twenty-one are named to go, and the skill of the riders and the stamina of the machines will be thoroughly tested.

       The Motorcycle on the Farm. If one is to believe the statements of the leading motorcycle manufacturers of the day and their statements seem logical, it is cheaper to make a trip to town on a motorcycle than to drive or walk. A manufacturer of one of these motorcycles (his particular make holds the world's record for economy) states that while the machine that made the world's record traveling fifty miles at a cost of less than one-tenth cent per mile over country roads was operated by an expert, it is nothing unusual for this particular make of motorcycle in the hands of an amateur to travel from six to eight miles on one cent's worth of gasoline. In comparison with the private riding horse the expense per mile is naturally much less and if one figures that while the driving horse must be fed daily, the motorcycle only 
       consumes while in use, the difference is still greater. The limit of a horse for continuous daily driving is probably thirty miles, while that of a motorcycle is over two hundred. Good traveling for a horse means four miles an hour; good traveling for a motorcycle, twenty miles a motorcycle from thirty to fifty miles per hour. In this age of scarce hired help, time, at some season is extremely valuable to the farmer. His ability to cover the distance to town and back with a motorcycle in one fifth of the road driving horse time and with no time wasted harnessing and unharnessing, is a factor to be considered. Most all the good motorcycles are now equipped with tandem attachments and luggage carriers, if desired. By means of this tandem attachment two can ride as well as one. The luggage carrier permits the carrying of 
       small freight, not exceeding 200 pounds. Many a farmer, as well as his children, have rebelled at their inability to go to town, to the swimming hole or the fishing grounds in the late summer evening, for a horse cannot be worked all day and be driven on the road at night. To these the motorcycle fills a long felt want. It is ever ready, costs nothing when idle and will last for years. It is really more expensive to be without a motorcycle than to own one, just as it is more expensive to plow with a hand plow, cradle the grain and use the flail instead of the modern appliances. The best makes of motorcycle today can be had for from $225 up. A motorcycle like many other pieces of machinery, can be built too cheaply to be good. There are, however, several well-established makes, which have years of successful manufacture
       behind them and one will not go amiss in choosing any of these. The motorcycle of today has come to stay. Already in the cities it is being adopted extensively by business firms because of the great time-saving its use assures. Repair men, inspection men, etc., can accomplish triple the work possible with their former horse and carriage. The saving of time as well as the great pleasure to be derived from its use has given the motorcycle a lasting place in the home of the American farmer.

       MOTOR CYCLES INVADE ALL FIELDS OF ACTIVITY. Preacher, Doctor, Policeman and Soldier Now Use Two-Wheeled Vehicles. Hundreds of daily demonstrations are proof of the utility, speed, and economy of the modern motor cycle. There is scarcely a field of activity that the two-wheeler has not entered and proved its value. The motor cycle carries the minister to reach his patient in less time than ever before, making it possible to eliminate many hours of human suffering. The motor cycle carried the minister of the gospel on his missions of mercy. The motor cycle is a part of every progressive police department, carrying mounted officers to the scene of crime or accident, and enabling them to run down violators of the law. The motor cycle aids the forest ranger in protecting our great timber lands from fire. The motor cycle 
       carries mail and delivers telegrams. The motor cycle rushes the important prescription to the bedside of the suffering. The motor cycle hurries the pulmotor to the beach, where every second counts, in the effort to restore life. A motor cycle mounted guard accompanies the President of the United States in his trips about the capital. Motor Cycle in War. Uses of the motor cycle in the army are almost unlimited. Motor cycle dispatch riders and scouts have won great fame for themselves in the present European struggle. Machine guns mounted on motor cycles are carried to their positions on the battlefield; motor cycles with side-cars hurry supplies to the Red Cross workers who are seeking to relieve the injured soldiers to the hospitals. "The motor cycle has revolutionized signaling on the battlefield," says Henry Beach 
       Needham, a war correspondent. It has practically done away with wig-wagging on the field. It is economical, efficient, and speedy; it is everywhere and nowhere as much as the front. For pleasure too, the motor cycle has made a definite place for itself. The ease with which the two-wheeler is operated, its reliability, and comfort make it an ideal vehicle for touring. Club sociability and endurance runs are enjoyed by thousands of riders all over the country every year. And more and more we hear of the long-distance tourist, riding from ocean to ocean, from gulf to lake, around the United States or circling the globe—for pleasure. Many of these long-distance tourists are women, who find as much pleasure in the sport as do the men. King "Eight" Car Arrives. The new 1915 eight-cylinder King touring car arrived last night, 
       and will be placed on exhibition at the local salesroom of William P. Barnhart &amp; Co., 1712 14th street northwest. The car has been on display at the national automobile show, and is making its debut in the National Capital. Awarded First Honors. William P. Barnhart, local distributor for the King in this section, has been awarded first prize in the contest for November and December on the sale of King motor cars.

       Billings Motorcycle Club Has Thrived Since 1913. Throughout most of the years since 1913 Billings has had an active motorcycle club. In those 27 years the city has watched [motorcycling] grow from a fad in which few cared to risk their necks, to the modern streamlined sport it is today, with scores of enthusiasts. Motorcycling has always had its thrills but the modern, high-powered machine goes further and combines all the speedy action of aquaplaning and flying, yet offers the pleasures and comforts of motoring. The city’s first motorcycle club in 1913 was a novel and, if it may be said, a noble experiment. It worked, and about a score of dashing young daredevils went in for motorbiking. Officers of that early club were George Bott, president; August Trutnau, vice president; Clarence H. Lauson, road lieutenant; E. J. Robb, activities chairman; 
       and Martin Curtis, racing chairman. With the horse and buggy era on the wane, young road demons, astraddle explosive two-wheeled gas burners, awed the town with feats of speed and daring. Motorcycling came into its own as one of the most popular sports of the day.Motorcycle racers thrilled thousands at the Midland Empire fair during the years from 1915 to 1920. In 1915 and 1916 races also were staged on a track at Joliet and hundreds of Billings fans traveled there regularly to watch those thrilling contests in which the more daring riders would sometimes hit a breakneck pace of “60 miles per hour.” State Racing Circuit In addition, there was a state motor-cycle racing circuit to coincide with fairs at Bozeman, Great Falls, Helena, Miles City, and Roundup. Several Billings riders competed in these early meets. They included Pat Curtis, Martin Curtis, 
       Bob Robb, George Tur-ner, Frank Boyd, Don Rieger, Fen Garvin, Johnny Thomas, Clar-ence Lauzon, Buck Engelhardt, Grant Lam-port and Fred Olsen. Favorite per-formers on the old Joliet racetrack were the Curtises, Turner, Robb, Nelson Wells and Frank Boyd. "Those were the good old days," it was the motorcyclists who braved the stretches of open road on which no operator of a horseless carriage would dare to tread. They tackled bridges across streams, stretches of deep sand, oozy gumbo and miles of mud to go on where some of the difficulties surrounding even these early circuits sub-dued the timid. The city's first motorcycle club maintained active membership until 1917, when several of its members entered service for the World War. Between 1918 and 1921 there was a lull in activities. The Billings club was reorganized in 1921 and has been a functioning organization since. 
       In the years 1914 to 1917 Ira S. Dille, Harry Williams, Frank Boyd, E. J. Robb, Alec McLeod served as club presi-dents and Robert E. "Bob" Cooke was secretary-treasurer. When reorganized in 1921 C. M. Lauzon was elected presi-dent, A. Nicolas, vice president, and Frank Polesek, secretary-treasurer. New Popularity Peak Motorcycling today has hit a new peak in popularity and the Billings club has a large active membership. There are approximately 100 of the two-wheeled machines registered in Yellowstone County. The Billings Motorcycle Club promotes a full active program each summer, highlighted by such events as gypsy tours, reliability runs, and hill climbs. The club has been affiliated with the American Motorcycle Association since 1929. Endurance or reliability runs of the Billings club date back to 1916, when a 126-mile trip was made to Miles City and return. Dirt 
       roads, turned to mud by heavy rains, tortuous hills, and ruts made this endurance test live long in the memories of the riders who participated, including R. E. Cooke, Clarence Lauzon, Pat Curtis, Martin Curtis, E. J. Robb, Johnny Thomas, Frank Hayes, Carl Aurich, Don Rieger, and Fred Olsen. Other riders who took part in events of the early motorcycle club and who still reside in Billings were Dr. C. H. Nelson, C. G. Gans, Jimmie Noyes, Horace Noyes, Bob Freeman, Glenn Farrell, Gus Wanderling, Eddie Eichenhard, Dan Davies, Walter Fultz, Bob Mitchell, and Peter Yeegen Jr. The club today is headed by Charles Lasher, president; Herman Judd, vice president; Andrew Dukes, treasurer; and Fred Olsen, secretary.
